===============

EasyDao is a lightweight, fast and flexible model and dao code generator.

# What is EasyDao? 

* no JPA
* no Hibernate
* no heavyweight tools
* no special knowledge
* no cost

* generate model as POJO
* generate Dao for Spring Framework JdbcTemplate
* CRUD Dao methods
* ultra lightweight dependency
* get meta information about database (metadata.txt)
* based on maven
* configuration is very simple
* configuration in pom.xml
* open source and free with MIT licence
* ultra fast code generation
* you can use it from Jenkins
* handling composite keys
* database design is convention over configuration
* flexible
* open source and free demo application
* learning time is about 5 minutes

> If you want to use it, then you need **easydao-maven-plugin** and **easydao-core**. You can see how to use it with demo applications: easydao-demo and easydao-demo-database-model. More information on GitHub page.

> If you want all sources or you are a developer of EasyDao, then clone the following repositories:

1. **easydao:** engine of easydao. It is generating source code from database. Runnable project for integration testing.
1. **easydao-core:** dependency all java source code that was generated by easydao.
1. **easydao-maven-plugin:** maven plugin for easydao, depends on _easydao._
1. **easydao-demo-database-model:** An example maven project for using easydao maven plugin in your project.
1. **easydao-demo:** An example application for using generated model classes.
1. and **easydao-project** (this one).

If you are using NetBeans, then **open easydao-project.** 

# EasyDao logic

> This section describes EasyDao logic. This means how to create your projects and database, and what conventions are.

There are four logic layer:
1. **Database:** this is your real database. It is important that table and field names are following naming conventions, e.g: if you prefixes tables (CUS_CUSTOMER), than all table must have prefix. Your table must have one primary key. **I advice that, do not use composite primary keys, but always use one primary key.** See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1383062/composite-primary-key 
1. **Dao and Model layer:** these classes generated from the database, and you never modify with hands. Dao classes directly reaches tables of database. The dao classes based on Spring Framework JdbcTemplate.
1. **DaoExt and DaoComp layer:** there are codes that was made by developers.
1. **Service layer:** Service classes contains Spring @Transactional annotation, and they are using Dao, DaoExt and DaoComp classes.

> DaoExt classes extends Dao classes, and contains several unique methods **for exactly one table.**


> DaoComp classes not related to one table. It is **using several tables with one complex query.**


> **Service layer never contains SQL codes!** It is using Dao classes: Dao, DaoExt and DaoComp.

**Automatic generated code, you never modify:** Model and Dao classes.

**DaoExt, DaoComp, Service depends on bussiness logic and created by developers.**
